# Graphical Calculator with Python

**Author**: Elias Alvarado

**Version**: 1.0

**License**: Apache License 2.0

## Overview
This project implements a **Graphical Calculator** using Python's **Tkinter** library. The calculator provides a clean and responsive user interface for performing various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, square roots, and more. Help documentation for developing this project can be found [Tkinter Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html). This library provides a robust and independent set of windowing tools, the main virtues of Tkinter are that it is fast.

## Features
- **Graphical Interface**: Designed with `Tkinter` for a modern look and smooth user experience.  
- **Mathematical Operations**:  
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division.  
  - Square root calculation.  
  - Clear and delete functionalities.  
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Error" for invalid operations.  
- **Customizable Design**: Colors and styles can be easily modified for personalization.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `Tkinter` (for GUI design)  
  - `Math` (for advanced mathematical operations)
 

## How to Use It

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphical-calculator.git  
   cd graphical-calculator
2. **Ensure you have installed Python. Then, run**:
    ```bash  
   python calculator.py
3. Interact with the Calculator:
   Use the buttons on the interface to perform calculations.

## Code Design
**Modular Structure**

- functions_design.py Handles all GUI design and logic.
- calculator.py Serves as the entry point to run the application.

## Future Enhancements

-  Add support for advanced mathematical operations (e.g. trigonometric functions).
-  Include history panel to view past calculations.
